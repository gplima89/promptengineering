5. **Practice:** Experiment with the perspective-based prompts
6. **Apply:** Use these techniques with your own data and scenarios

## 💡 Key Concepts Covered

### Progressive Prompt Evolution
- **Level 1:** Basic summary (vague prompt → generic output)
- **Level 2:** Summary + prioritized task list (structured prompt → organized output)
- **Level 3:** Comprehensive analysis with metrics, risks, and visualizations (advanced prompt → executive-ready report)

### Perspective-Based Prompts
Learn how to craft prompts that extract exactly what each role needs:
- **HR Focus:** Team health, capacity, retention, organizational development
- **Sales Focus:** Competitive threats, revenue impact, customer risks, go-to-market strategy
- **Engineering Focus:** Technical delivery, capacity analysis, risk assessment, timeline revalidation
- **Management Focus:** Strategic decisions, cross-functional alignment, stakeholder communication, financial outlook
